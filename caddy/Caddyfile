# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

DOMAIN.TLD {
    tls email@example.com {
      dns cloudflare {env.CF_API_TOKEN}
    }
    encode zstd gzip
    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /var/www/html/

    # Serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    php_fastcgi php:9000
    rewrite * /index.php?{query}

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server
}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
